I’m Francisco, a Mechanical Engineer and researcher with a PhD in Microrobotics. I focus on designing, modeling, simulating, and controlling complex dynamical systems at both micro and macro scales.

For my PhD, I worked on developing and characterizing innovative microactuators based on fluid joints, combining hands-on experiments with advanced modeling and control techniques. During my master’s, I specialized in underwater vehicle dynamics, guidance, navigation, and control, gaining practical experience with vehicle modeling, sensor integration, and control system design.

Alongside my formal studies, I’ve explored Reinforcement Learning through personal projects, using deep learning tools to create intelligent control systems. This self-driven learning has helped me build more adaptive and autonomous solutions.

I’ve also spent time building test benches, developing software for real-time data acquisition, and applying advanced control strategies.

Outside of work, I love spending time outdoors — exploring nature keeps me grounded and inspired. Whether I’m on a challenging trail or tackling a tough problem, curiosity and a passion for solving real-world challenges keep me motivated.

Feel free to check out my projects to see how I apply my skills to a range of challenges in engineering and research.
