# Introduction

This post presents one of the topics of my PhD research, which focused first on studying and then controlling the deformation of droplets with the goal of eventually using them as actuators.  
You can find more detailed information in the paper: *Design and Modeling of Electrohydrodynamically Driven Droplets for Fluid Joints Microactuators*, or in my PhD thesis.

The principle behind this actuation is to exploit the dominance of surface tension forces at the microscale to create compact actuators using electric fields.  
These electric fields are generated by electrodes fabricated using cleanroom techniques. The fields induce ion movement inside the droplet, which leads to its deformation and flattening.

By developing a physical model of the system, droplet control can be achieved in open-loop by inverting the model.

# Results

Here is one result showing open-loop control of the droplet:
